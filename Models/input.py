from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = Image.open('path_to_your_image.png')

# Resize the image to the size your model expects. For example, if you're using
# VGG16 as in your previous example, you should resize to (224, 224).
img = img.resize((224, 224))

# Convert the image to a numpy array
img_array = np.array(img)

# If your model expects the input to be in a certain range, such as [0, 1],
# you should normalize the pixel values. Since PNG pixel values are in the
# range [0, 255], you can normalize by dividing by 255.
img_array = img_array / 255.0

# Finally, your model will expect a batch of images as input, even if you're
# just predicting on one image. You can add an extra dimension to represent
# the batch size with np.expand_dims.
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

# Now you can pass img_array to your model's prediction method
# predictions = model.predict(img_array)
